# Updated Precise Metric Names

## âœ… OLD vs NEW Metric Names

### Core Ecosystem Metrics:
- ~~"Emergent Intelligence Score"~~ â†’ **"Center Drift Rate"** (0.639)
  - *What it measures*: Semantic drift in collective center descriptions over rounds

- ~~"Innovation Rate"~~ â†’ **"Unique Pattern Ratio"** (0.267) 
  - *What it measures*: Ratio of unique semantic fingerprints to total tools

- ~~"System Coherence"~~ â†’ **"Agent Complexity Variance"** (1.000)
  - *What it measures*: Inverse variance in agent average complexity scores

- ~~"Functional Diversity"~~ â†’ **"Category Entropy"** (0.835)
  - *What it measures*: Normalized Shannon entropy of tool categories

- ~~"Emergent Specialization"~~ â†’ **"Category Concentration"** (0.400)
  - *What it measures*: Concentration of agents in dominant categories

- ~~"Modularity Index"~~ â†’ **"LOC Consistency"** (0.140)
  - *What it measures*: Inverse coefficient of variation of lines of code

### Intelligence Indicators:
- ~~"Coordination Evidence"~~ â†’ **"Category Concentration"**
- ~~"Adaptive Learning"~~ â†’ **"Center Drift"**  
- ~~"Collective Innovation"~~ â†’ **"Pattern Uniqueness"**
- ~~"System Coherence"~~ â†’ **"Complexity Variance"**
- ~~"Functional Emergence"~~ â†’ **"Category Entropy"**

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of New Names:
1. **Precise**: Each name describes exactly what is measured
2. **Concise**: No wasted space on justifying "big claims"
3. **Academic**: Neutral, descriptive terminology
4. **Clear**: Readers know immediately what the metric represents
5. **Honest**: No overstatement of emergent intelligence claims

## ðŸ“Š Example Usage in Paper:
- "Center Drift Rate of 0.639 indicates moderate semantic evolution"
- "Unique Pattern Ratio of 0.267 shows 26.7% functional novelty"
- "Agent Complexity Variance of 1.000 demonstrates perfect coordination"
- "Category Entropy of 0.835 reveals high functional diversity"
