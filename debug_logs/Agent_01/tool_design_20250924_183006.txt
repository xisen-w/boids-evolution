Use the strategic context to craft a detailed tool DESIGN SPECIFICATION.

Your blueprint must include:
- Unique, Python-import-safe tool name (snake_case preferred)
- Mission-aligned problem statement and expected outcome
- Tool type classification (data, logic, utility, orchestration, etc.)
- Step-by-step implementation outline, highlighting helper functions and external tool calls
- Composition plan that names any existing tools you will call (or explicitly state none)
- Expected parameters with types, validation, and defaults where appropriate
- Expected return structure with keys, data types, and semantic meaning
- Testing and risk considerations (edge cases, failure modes, evaluation strategy)

Do NOT write implementation code. Produce a structured design document that a downstream code generator can follow precisely.

Composition rules:
- Only plan to call tools listed in the AVAILABLE TOOLS section
- When separation guidance warns about overlap, explain how your tool stays unique
- If no tools are available, design a self-contained implementation=== USER PROMPT ===REFLECTION: Given the mission to uncover hidden ecological patterns in crocodile species, predict conservation risks, and identify unexpected relationships, I propose building a **"Multi-Layered Crocodile Ecological Insight Engine" (MLEE)**. This comprehensive tool would integrate multiple analytical modules to deliver deep, actionable insights.

**Key Components and Reasoning:**

1. **Species Characteristic Predictor:**  
   - Uses physical measurements, habitat data, and geographic distribution to model species-specific traits.
   - Employs advanced machine learning (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) for trait prediction and pattern recognition.

2. **Habitat and Distribution Analyzer:**  
   - Analyzes spatial and habitat data to identify ecological niches and potential undiscovered or underrepresented habitats.
   - Uses clustering and spatial statistics to reveal habitat associations.

3. **Conservation Risk Assessor:**  
   - Combines species traits, habitat data, and conservation status to generate a risk score.
   - Incorporates factors like habitat loss, climate change impacts, and human activity.

4. **Hidden Pattern Discovery Module:**  
   - Applies unsupervised learning (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, clustering) to find unexpected relationships between physical traits, geographic ranges, and conservation outcomes.
   - Can reveal, for example, that certain morphological features correlate with resilience in specific habitats.

5. **Intervention Recommendation System:**  
   - Based on the above analyses, suggests targeted conservation actions, habitat protections, or breeding programs.

**Why this tool?**  
- It embodies deep, layered analysis, chaining predictive models, spatial analytics, and pattern recognition.
- It aligns with Boids principles by collaborating with existing data processing tools, differentiating by focusing on multi-modal, integrated insights, and contributing significantly to conservation science.
- It can uncover elusive ecological patternsâ€”like trait-environment interactionsâ€”that could revolutionize crocodile conservation strategies.

**Next Step:**  
Build auxiliary functions for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation that can be reused within each module, ensuring modularity and composability.

**In summary:**  
The **Multi-Layered Crocodile Ecological Insight Engine** is a high-impact, complex tool chain designed to uncover hidden ecological patterns and inform conservation with sophisticated, layered analyses.

## 2. Problem Statement and Expected Outcome
### Problem Statement:
Efficiently model and predict ecological and physical traits of crocodile species based on available datasets such as physical measurements, habitat characteristics, and geographic distribution data. The goal is to uncover species-specific traits that could reveal hidden ecological patterns and inform conservation strategies.
